**Note**: Visit the live platform to explore the full functionality of the ShibaWork 🦊 platform.

## Project Overview

ShibaWork 🦊 is a Web3-based platform that connects clients and freelancers. Clients can create jobs, push them to the blockchain, and collaborate with freelancers. The platform ensures transparent and secure job management using blockchain technology.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Blockchain Development**: Hardhat, Solidity
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Additional Technologies**:
  - Etherjs SDK
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Nginx (Reverse Proxy)

## System Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Job Management**
   - Clients can create job postings.
   - Jobs are pushed to the blockchain for transparency.
   - Freelancers can pick jobs and collaborate with clients.

2. **Backend Workflow**
   - Django REST API for job management.
   - Worker service for transaction monitoring.
   - Smart contract integration for secure payment handling.
